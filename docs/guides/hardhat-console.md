# Using the Hardhat console

Hardhat comes built-in with an interactive JavaScript console. You can use it by running `npx hardhat console`:
```
$ npx hardhat console
All contracts have already been compiled, skipping compilation.
>
```

The `compile` task will be called before opening the console prompt, but you can skip this with the `--no-compile` parameter.

The execution environment for the console is the same as for tasks. This means the configuration has been processed, and the [Hardhat Runtime Environment] initialized and injected into the global scope. For example, you'll have globally scoped access to the `config` object:
```
> config
{ defaultNetwork: 'hardhat',
  solc:
   { version: '0.5.8', optimizer: { enabled: false, runs: 200 } },
  
  ...
 
}
>
```

And the initialized `ethers` object if you're using the `hardhat-ethers` plugin:
```
> ethers
{ provider:
   EthersProviderWrapper {
       
  ...

  },
  getContract: [AsyncFunction: getContract],
  signers: [AsyncFunction: signers] }
>
```

And the `artifacts` object if you're using the `hardhat-truffle5` plugin, and so on. 

Anything that has been injected into the [Hardhat Runtime Environment] will be magically available in the global scope, or if you're a more explicit kind of developer, you can also require the HRE explicitly and get autocomplete:

TODO-HH: re-run this

```
> const hardhat = require("hardhat")
undefined
> hardhat.
hardhat.__defineGetter__      hardhat.__defineSetter__      hardhat.__lookupGetter__      hardhat.__lookupSetter__      hardhat.__proto__
hardhat.hasOwnProperty        hardhat.isPrototypeOf         hardhat.propertyIsEnumerable  hardhat.toLocaleString        hardhat.toString
hardhat.valueOf

hardhat._runTaskDefinition    hardhat.constructor           hardhat.injectToGlobal

hardhat._extenders            hardhat.hardhatArguments      hardhat.config                hardhat.ethereum              hardhat.ethers
hardhat.network               hardhat.run                   hardhat.tasks

>
```

You will also notice that the console keeps a history of your commands, as you'd expect out of most interactive terminals, including across different sessions. Try it by pressing the up arrow key.

### Asynchronous operations and top-level await

Interacting with the Ethereum network and your smart contracts are asynchronous operations, hence most APIs and libraries
use JavaScript's `Promise` for returning values.   

To make things easier, Hardhat's console supports top-level `await` (i.e. `console.log(await web3.eth.getBalance()`). This feature requires Node 10 or higher.
